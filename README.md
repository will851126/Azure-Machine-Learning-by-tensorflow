# ML server on Azure


1. In this series, we will introduce how to build **Classification** with Azure  ML Services by **Auto Machine Learning Feature**, **Azure machine Learning service** to quickly build, train and deploy machine learning models at scale; or build custom models with support for all the popular open-source frameworks

2. we will Build Tensorflow model on **Virtual Studio Code**, use **Virtual Studio Code** extension libery help us a long as submit `train.py` , `Score.py` and `env-yml` that will do implement machine Learning pipeline and deploy  model  



## Prerequisites
* An Azure  account

* An Microsoft Account or a work or school account
